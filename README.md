# Telegram Bot for RSS feeds

> Bots are *hot*.

Here's a bot for [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) which lets you use it as a feed reader. You can [use our instance](https://telegram.me/superfeedr_bot) directly, but you shoudl make sure you deploy your own version if it!

## Features

For now, it's very basic and lets you subscribe, unsubscribe and list feeds to which you're subscribed.
Everytime a feed updates, you get a message.

## Deploy

Please, [see this blog post](https://blog.superfeedr.com/rss-bot-telegram-lambda/).

## TODO

Adding support for keyboards would be a great idea!
